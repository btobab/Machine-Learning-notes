    "In the last issue, we learned the derivation process of the formula of PCA, but it is more troublesome in practical use. The co-variance matrix needs to be obtained first, and then apply singular value decomposition to it. Therefore, the more common method is to directly perform singular value decomposition on the centralized data set.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, using principal component analysis, we finally get a new coordinate base. To reduce the dimension of the data set, we also need to project the coordinates. Therefore, this issue will introduce a similar but simpler method: principal coordinate analysis ($PCoA$)"
